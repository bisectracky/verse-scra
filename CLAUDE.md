# Verse-Scra: Web3 Space Mining Game

## Project Overview

Verse-Scra is a blockchain-based space mining game where players can mine resources from different planets across a fictional solar system called the Zephyr System. Each planet represents a different blockchain network and contains unique resources that players can mine through a lottery-style smart contract system.

## Game Concept

### Core Mechanics
- **Planet-based Mining**: 8 unique planets, each connected to specific smart contracts on different blockchain networks
- **Lottery Mining System**: Players purchase mining tickets/operations rather than guaranteed rewards
- **Chainlink Oracle Integration**: Uses Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to determine mining success rates
- **Token Rewards**: Each planet's contract holds various token resources that can be won
- **Guaranteed Returns**: Contracts always return some reward, but amounts vary based on luck and oracle results

### Planets & Networks
1. **Solanium** (Solana-themed) - Fast transaction processing world
2. **Ethereus** (Ethereum-themed) - Storm world with lightning networks  
3. **ZANO** (Privacy-focused) - Stealth and anonymity features
4. **Ferrum** (Iron/Metal-themed) - Volcanic mining world
5. **Lumina** (Light-themed) - Ocean world with ether islands
6. **TITANOX** (Forest world) - Merkle tree structures
7. **Base** (Base chain) - Shell world foundation
8. **Voidara** (Phase-shifting) - Quantum mechanics world

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19** - Modern UI framework
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Bun** - Package manager and runtime
- **Thirdweb SDK v5** - Web3 integration and wallet connections
- **CSS3** - Custom animations and 3D planet visualizations
- **React Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling

### Blockchain Integration
- **Multi-chain Support**: Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Arbitrum
- **Smart Contracts**: Each planet has dedicated mining contracts
- **Chainlink Oracles**: VRF for randomness in mining outcomes
- **Token Standards**: ERC-20 tokens as mining rewards
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect

### Smart Contract Flow
1. **Purchase Mining Operation**: User pays fee to start mining
2. **Oracle Request**: Contract requests randomness from Chainlink
3. **Wait for Callback**: Frontend polls contract for oracle response
4. **Determine Rewards**: Oracle result determines token payout amount
5. **Claim Rewards**: User receives tokens (always some amount, never zero)

- Thirdweb account for client ID

### Installation
```bash
bun install
```

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file:
```env
VITE_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=your_thirdweb_client_id_here
```

### Development Server
```bash
bun run dev
```

### Build for Production

- ðŸ”² Mining operation purchasing system
- ðŸ”² Token reward distribution
- ðŸ”² Mining history and statistics
- ðŸ”² Planet ownership mechanics

### Smart Contract Requirements

#### Mining Contract Interface
```solidity
// Each planet will have a contract implementing this interface
interface IPlanetMining {
    function startMiningOperation(uint256 ticketPrice) external payable;
    function checkMiningResult(address miner) external view returns (bool completed, uint256 reward);
    function claimRewards() external;
    function getPlanetResources() external view returns (address[] memory tokens, uint256[] memory amounts);
    function getMinerCount() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

## Contributing

This project is designed to be AI-agent friendly for development assistance. All major components are well-documented and follow React best practices. The codebase is structured for easy expansion and modification.

### Development Notes for AI Agents
- Use Bun for package management (not npm/yarn)
- Follow existing component patterns in `/src/components/`
- Maintain the space/cosmic theme in any new UI elements
- All new smart contract interactions should go through Thirdweb SDK
- Error handling is critical - always wrap risky operations in try/catch
- CSS animations are important to the game feel - preserve existing animations

### Key Commands
- `bun run dev` - Start development server
- `bun run build` - Build for production  
- `bun run preview` - Preview production build
- `bun install` - Install dependencies
- `bun add <package>` - Add new dependencies
